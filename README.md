# Background

Porphyria is a group of eight inherited genetic disorders that arise when the body is unable to synthesize heme used to transport oxygen throughout the body. This negatively affects the skin and/or nervous system causing symptoms including extreme abdominal and chest pain, skin blistering, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and possibly leading to paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures.
Porphyria is divided into two main types, acute and cutaneous, depending on the most commonly experienced symptoms. Acute Porphyrias typically present with attacks of symptoms, like intense abdominal pain or skin blistering, which become more severe over several days. Cutaneous Porphyrias may result in skin blistering, redness, scarring, and pain when exposed to the sun.
Likely affecting 1 to 100 people in every 50,000, Porphyria is a rare disease which on average takes 10-15 years to diagnose following the onset of symptoms. Once Porphyria is recognized diagnostic testing can be performed via blood, urine, stool and genetic testing.
